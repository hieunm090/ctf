General Tips:

Don't overthink it: Often, the simplest solution is the correct one. Try low-effort methods first before diving into complex approaches.
Look closely, but also step back: Examine details, but don't get tunnel vision. Sometimes, the answer is hidden in plain sight (e.g., ASCII art, flag format).
Use the right tools: Different platforms have different behaviors (e.g., newline characters). Choose tools compatible with the challenge environment.
Consider the context: Web challenges with many solves likely have a simpler exploit than cracking advanced encryption.
Test multiple inputs: Sometimes, luck plays a role. Try different inputs to see if there's a pattern.
Utilize resources: Many online tools can help decode ciphers, identify file types, and analyze forensics data (e.g., CyberChef, decompilers).
Challenge Categories:

Crypto: Classic ciphers are more about recognizing them and using appropriate tools. Modern crypto might require deeper understanding and research.
Web: Flags might be hidden in URLs, robots.txt, source code, or require bypassing security mechanisms (easier or harder depending on the challenge).
Forensics: Tools and techniques to extract data from corrupted files, hidden files, and hidden information within files (e.g., steganography).
