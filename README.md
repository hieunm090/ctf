## General Tips

- **Don't overthink it:** Often, the simplest solution is the correct one. Start with low-effort methods before diving into complex approaches.
- **Look closely, but also step back:** Pay attention to details, but avoid tunnel vision. Sometimes the answer is hidden in plain sight (e.g., ASCII art, flag format).
- **Use the right tools:** Different platforms behave differently (e.g., newline characters). Choose tools compatible with the challenge environment.
- **Consider the context:** Web challenges with many solves likely have a simpler exploit than cracking advanced encryption.
- **Test multiple inputs:** Sometimes, luck plays a role. Try different inputs to see if there's a pattern.
- **Utilize resources:** Many online tools can help decode ciphers, identify file types, and analyze forensics data (e.g., CyberChef, decompilers).

## Challenge Categories

- **Crypto:** Recognize classic ciphers and use appropriate tools. Modern crypto may require deeper understanding and research.
- **Web:** Flags might be hidden in URLs, `robots.txt`, source code, or require bypassing security mechanisms.
- **Forensics:** Use tools and techniques to extract data from corrupted files, hidden files, or hidden information within files (e.g., steganography).

## Additional Resources
